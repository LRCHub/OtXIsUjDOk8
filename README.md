[00:17.86] I feel the night explode
[00:22.06] When we're together
[00:26.21] Emotion overload
[00:29.89] In the heat of pleasure
[00:41.39] 
[00:33.73] Take me I'm yours
[00:35.92] Into your arms
[00:37.98] Never let me go
[00:42.22] Tonight, I really need to know
[00:57.22] 
[00:49.03] Tell it to my heart
[00:50.94] Tell me I'm the only one
[00:52.93] Is this really love or just a game?
[00:57.19] Tell it to my heart
[00:59.19] I can feel my body rock
[01:01.49] Every time you call my name
[01:14.99] 
[01:06.66] The passion's so complete
[01:10.86] It's never ending
[01:15.04] As long as I receive
[01:18.84] The message you're sending
[01:31.84] 
[01:22.54] Body to body
[01:24.42] Soul to soul
[01:26.87] Always feel you near
[01:31.08] So say the words I long to hear
[01:46.58] 
[01:37.80] Tell it to my heart
[01:39.84] Tell me I'm the only one
[01:41.70] Is this really love or just a game?
[01:45.97] Tell it to my heart
[01:47.96] I can feel my body rock
[01:50.27] Every time you call my name
[02:03.77] 
[02:11.18] Love, love on the run
[02:14.33] Breaking us down
[02:16.70] Though we keep holdin' on
[02:20.14] I don't want to lose
[02:22.50] No, I can't let you go
[02:33.50] 
[02:30.62] Tell it to my heart
[02:32.73] Tell me I'm the only one
[02:34.84] Is this really love or just a game?
[02:38.84] Tell it to my heart
[02:40.92] I can feel my body rock
[02:43.36] Every time you call my name
[02:56.86] 
[02:48.88] Tell it to my heart
[02:51.06] Tell me from the start
[02:52.99] Tell it to my heart, heart, heart, heart
[02:57.07] Tell it to my heart
[02:59.05] Tell me from the start
[03:01.28] Tell it to my heart, heart, heart, heart
[03:05.34] Never make it stop
[03:06.82] Oh, take it to the heart, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
[03:28.82] 
[03:11.42] Tell it to my heart
[03:13.58] Tell me I'm the only one
[03:15.37] Is this really love or just a game?

[03:21.56] I can feel my body rock
[03:23.95] Every time you call my name
[03:37.45] 
[03:27.64] Tell it to my heart
[03:29.50] Tell me I'm the only one
[03:31.76] Is this really love or just a game
